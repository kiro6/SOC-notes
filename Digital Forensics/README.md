|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File Metadata                  | NTFS stores extensive metadata for each file, including creation time, modification time, access time, and attribute information.                |
| MFT Entries                    | The Master File Table (MFT) stores metadata for all files and directories on a volume, providing insights into file names, sizes, and timestamps.|
| File Slack and Unallocated Space | Unallocated space may contain remnants of deleted files or fragments of data. File slack refers to the unused portion of a cluster.               |
| File Signatures                | File headers and signatures can identify file types even when file extensions are changed or obscured.                                           |
| USN Journal                    | The Update Sequence Number (USN) Journal records changes made to files and directories, allowing tracking of file modifications and deletions.     |
| LNK Files                      | Windows shortcut files contain information about target files/programs and timestamps, providing insights into recent activities.                  |
| Prefetch Files                 | Prefetch files generated by Windows indicate which programs have been run on the system and when they were last executed.                        |
| Registry Hives                 | Windows Registry hives contain important configuration and system information, revealing traces of malicious activities or unauthorized changes.  |
| Shellbags                      | Shellbags store folder view settings, revealing user navigation patterns and accessed folders.                                                    |
| Thumbnail Cache                | Thumbnail caches reveal recently viewed files, even if the originals are deleted.                                                                |
| Recycle Bin                    | The Recycle Bin contains deleted files, providing insights into user actions.                                                                    |
| Alternate Data Streams (ADS)   | ADS are additional data streams associated with files, sometimes used maliciously to hide data.                                                    |
| Volume Shadow Copies           | Volume Shadow Copies are snapshots of the file system at different points in time, valuable for data recovery and analysis.                        |
| Security Descriptors and ACLs  | Access Control Lists (ACLs) and security descriptors determine file/folder permissions, aiding in understanding access rights and security breaches.|
